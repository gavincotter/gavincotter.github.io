 This website was bourne out of necessity. I created the site as a way for me to get a full and thorough understanding of the peer to peer
electronic cash system which is, Bitcoin. 

 To get a thorough understanding requires the understanding of Digital Signatures, 
Symetric/Asymetric Encryption, Digital Certificates, Peer to Peer Networking, Consensus algorithms, SSL/TLS, ledgers, double-entry book keeping.
Writing about a topic is a good way to get something clear in your mind. While reading books i found it neccesary to take notes as i went. 
After which i'd reflect on.
