Find a suitable surface to lay your laptop on. Ideal height is one in which
the elbows are bent at a 90 degree angle.

Standing using the laptop, bend right leg at the knee and Stand on your left
leg only, tense gluteous medius to stop gravity pulling yourtorso down.
When you feel the muscle is worked enough, allow your torso to
naturally pivot clockwise "if it doesn't, ring 999". 
Now slowly, ""slowly"  allow gravity to pull your torso down "5 secs" ,hold "5 secs" and
pull fast "1 secs" torso back up level. Repeat untill muscl is worked enough.

When I do this on my right leg I notice a weakness straight away.

Doing this on both legs while standing typing on your laptop is a good way to
strenghten your gluteos medius.
