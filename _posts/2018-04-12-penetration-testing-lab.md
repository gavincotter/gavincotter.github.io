<pre>
My home lab consists of 2 laptops, 1 raspberry pi, all networked together using a single switch.
Laptop a runs kali linux
Laptop b runs winows server 2012r2, windows 10, pfSense.

windows server 2012 is setup as a domain controller and the other machines are all joined to the domain.
The pfsense is used to route between my home network and my domain network.
