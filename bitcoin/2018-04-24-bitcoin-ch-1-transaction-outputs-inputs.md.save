Transaction Outputs and Inputs



how transactions build a chain


generate a public and private RSA key pair


append only transaction ledgers
genesis file.part-0


send intention to address ( digitalsignature.bin, public.key, hash )
listen for destination address equal to yours
if address is equal and if sender owns private key 
put in outputs box


intention equals hash(data)=thehash, encrypt(private.key,thehash)=signature.bin
owns private key equals decrypt signature and compare hash
